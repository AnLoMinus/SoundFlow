🔥 PowerRise – Freestyle Verse (by AnLoMinus)
(Flow 180 BPM, cinematic trap rhythm)

(Beat drops – spark ignition ⚡)

Yo, I rise from the dark like voltage divine,
Light through the storm, every spark is a sign.
AnLoMinus in motion, energy devotion,
Waves of creation, electric emotion.

Breathe fire, inhale the flame,
No fear in the code, I rewrite my name.
From chaos to cosmos, design to the core,
When the spark awakens, I'm ready for more.

Bass hits deep – like thunder in my veins,
Faith in my soul, it breaks all chains.
Every step's a covenant, sound is my prayer,
PowerRise forever – I'm already there.

(Synth glow outro 🌌)
